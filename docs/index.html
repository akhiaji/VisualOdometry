<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Abstract</h3>

We will develop a visual odometry system that tracks the pose of the camera throughout a video sequence. This involves elements of feature detection and matching, image rotation and translation, and consensus gathering to build a complex system.<br><br>

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
One of the most fundamental algorithms for mobile robotics is Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). SLAM is used by a robot to discern where in the world it is, and build a map around itself. In this project we plan on replicating a crucial component of SLAM called Visual Odometry(VO). VO is the process of using a camera to verify the position of a robot. This can be very useful as the redundancy in odometry helps to reduce drift in the system as error slowly builds up.
<br><br>
The system we will be developing will take in an RGB-D video feed generated by a kinect and will plot the movement of the camera around the world. Our system will tag each frame of the video with the (x,y,z, unit quaternion) of the camera when it took this image based on the predicted position of the previous image and transformation between the two images.
<br><br>
This problem is particularly interesting because it combines many of the tools we have discussed in class in a layered fashion. Edges must be extracted to help define features for SIFT to extract and match followed by finding the homography matrix to understand the relationship between each of the images. Each level of the process will require that the previous step was done with as little noise seeping through as possible. This means that there will always be additional features we can implement to reduce noise or allow the system to run faster. In addition visual odometry as a subject is still under research. As robots are becoming more ubiquitous and cheap they use fewer and cheaper sensors. As a result, simple cameras are doing the job that previously was accomplished with other sensors such as lidar. While our primary goal is to get visual odometry working with color and depth information we will compare its performance with that of a monocular system which is currently on the cutting edge of research.

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
